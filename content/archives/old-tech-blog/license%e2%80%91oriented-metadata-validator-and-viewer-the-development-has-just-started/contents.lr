Creative Commons [participates](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/cc/about.html) in [Google Summer of Code™](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/) and has accepted a proposal (see the [abstract](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/cc/appinfo.html?csaid=3C284456287C63B9)) of [Hugo Dworak](http://hugo.dworak.info/) based on its description of a task to [rewrite](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Rewrite_Metadata_Validator "Rewrite Metadata Validator") its now-defunct [metadata validator](http://validator.creativecommons.org/ "http://validator.creativecommons.org"). [Asheesh Laroia](http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#83) has been assigned as the mentor of the project. The work began on May 26th, 2008 as per the [project timeline](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/faqs.html#0.1_timeline). It is expected to be completed in twelve weeks. More details will be provided in the [dedicated CC Wiki article](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Rewrite_Metadata_Validator/SoC_2008) and the progress will be weekly featured on this blog.

The project focuses on developing an on-line tool — free software written in Python — to validate digitally embedded Creative Commons licenses within files of different types. Files will be pasted directly to a form, identified by a URL, or uploaded by a user. The application will present the results in a human?readable fashion and notify the user if the means used to express the license terms are deprecated.
