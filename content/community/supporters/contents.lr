## Volunteers

Countless people have contributed code, documentation, translations, and
insight to CC's technology efforts. Thank you to all volunteers and community
members that have supported our free/libre and open source (FOSS) activities.

*TODO: Write a script and GitHub action in
[creativecommons/ccos-scripts][ccos-scripts] to populate this section (or a sub
page) with all GitHub contributors.*

## Standards

We hope that some day the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
will no longer hold their standards ransom for a purchase fee.
