description: To facilitate the community in finding ways to contribute that
match their experiences and skillsets, we have developed a comprehensive system
for labelling issues and PRs. This is an introduction to this standard
labelling scheme.
---
body:

Labels consist of three fields, viz. name, description and color. Label names
should have a consistent format to aid both filtering within the github UI as
well as scanning visually through the list. The following format is the most
suited to this task (where `⎵` denotes a single space):

```
<emoji>⎵<category>:⎵<name>
```

Even label names with more than two words in the text should be separated by a
single space `⎵`.

## List of labels

An issue has many different attributes:
- Priority
- Status
- Goal
- Aspect
- Skill
- Talk
- Friendliness


### *Priority

<div class="table-container">
  <table class="datatable display">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="5"><strong>Priority color chart</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
   <tr>
   <td class="bg-unfavourable">Unfavourable</td>
   <td class="bg-negative">Negative</td>
   <td class="bg-neutral">Neutral</td>
   <td class="bg-positive">Positive</td>
   <td class="bg-favourable">Favourable</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td class="bg-unfavourable">#b60205</td>
   <td class="bg-negative">#ff9f1c</td>
   <td class="bg-neutral">#ffcc00</td>
   <td class="bg-positive">#cfda2c</td>
   <td class="bg-favourable">#008672</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

The priority of an issue is based on its impact, derived from a combination of
urgency and importance. This determines the importance of the issue when sprint
planning or deciding which issues to tackle next.

- <span class="gh-label priority-unfavourable">
    🟥 priority: critical
  </span>
  - **Description:** Must be fixed ASAP
- <span class="gh-label priority-negative">
    🟧 priority: high
  </span>
  - **Description:** Stalls work on the project or its dependents
- <span class="gh-label priority-neutral">
    🟨 priority: medium
  </span>
  - **Description:** Not blocking but should be fixed soon
- <span class="gh-label priority-positive">
    🟩 priority: low
  </span>
  - **Description:** Low priority and doesn't need to be rushed


### *Status

<div class="table-container">
  <table class="datatable display">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="5"><strong>Status color chart</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td class="bg-lighter">Lighter</td>
   <td class="bg-light">Light</td>
   <td class="bg-medium">Medium</td>
   <td class="bg-dark">Dark</td>
   <td class="bg-darker">Darker</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td class="bg-lighter">#eeeeee</td>
   <td class="bg-light">#cccccc</td>
   <td class="bg-medium">#999999</td>
   <td class="bg-dark">#666666</td>
   <td class="bg-darker">#333333</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

The status of the issue determines whether it is ready for work or not. Issues
may not be ready to be worked on for a number of reasons and the maintainers
must keep updating the labels as the situation evolves.

An issue, at the time of closing can have either the
<span class="gh-label status-light">
  🏁 status: ready for dev
</span>
or the
<span class="gh-label status-lighter">
  ⛔️ status: discarded
</span>
label based on whether it was closed with or without resolution, respectively.

- <span class="gh-label status-darker">
    🚦 status: awaiting triage
  </span>
  - **Description:** Has not been triaged & therefore, not ready for work
- <span class="gh-label status-neutral">
    🚧 status: blocked
  </span>
  - **Description:** Blocked & therefore, not ready for work
- <span class="gh-label status-lighter">
    ⛔️ status: discarded
  </span>
  - **Description:** Will not be worked on
- <span class="gh-label status-lighter">
    🙅 status: discontinued
  </span>
  - **Description:** Not suitable for work as repo is in maintenance
- <span class="gh-label status-dark">
    🏷 status: label work required
  </span>
  - **Description:** Needs proper labelling before it can be worked on
- <span class="gh-label status-light">
    🏁 status: ready for dev
  </span>
  - **Description:** Ready for work
- <span class="gh-label status-dark">
    🧹 status: ticket work required
  </span>
  - **Description:** Needs more details before it can be worked on


### *Goal

The goal of an issue is the end-result achieved when the issue is resolved. This
represents the impact of the issue on the scope of the software.

- <span class="gh-label goal">⭐ goal: addition</span>
  - **Description:** Addition of new feature
- <span class="gh-label goal">🛠 goal: fix</span>
  - **Description:** Bug fix
- <span class="gh-label goal">✨ goal: improvement</span>
  - **Description:** Improvement to an existing feature


### *Aspect

The aspect of an issue is the side of the project that the issue deals with. A
single codebase can have multiple aspects to it and knowing which ones will be
touched helps contributors find relevant issues.

- <span class="gh-label aspect">💻 aspect: code</span>
  - **Description:** Concerns the software code in the repository
- <span class="gh-label aspect">📖 aspect: docs</span>
  - **Description:** Concerns the documentation in the repository
- <span class="gh-label aspect">🤖 aspect: dx</span>
  - **Description:** Concerns developers' experience with the codebase
- <span class="gh-label aspect">🕹 aspect: interface</span>
  - **Description:** Concerns end-users' experience with the software
- <span class="gh-label aspect">📄 aspect: text</span>
  - **Description:** Concerns the textual material in the repository


### Skill

The technical skills a person is required to possess to work on the issue.
Skills are a special type of label that vary by repository. Issues may not have
a skill tag if no special skills are required.

- <span class="gh-label skill">💪 skill: &lt;skill name&gt;</span>
  - **Description:** Requires proficiency in '&lt;skill name&gt;'


### Talk

Issues with interaction labels do not entail any work to be done on the
repository. They are for Q&A, RFCs and any other form of discussions. While
both of these may appear to be too similar, triage permissions are granted to
collaborators who might not have the answers to questions but by labelling them
as such, they might draw a faster response from an experienced contributor who
does. _In the future this category might be rendered redundant by GitHub
Discussions and will be removed._

- <span class="gh-label talk">💬 talk: discussion</span>
  - **Description:** Open for discussions and feedback
- <span class="gh-label talk">❓ talk: question</span>
  - **Description:** Can be resolved with an answer


### Friendliness

The level of friendliness a particular issue is the valency of the issue
towards contributions from the community. Some issues provide a great
introduction while others require a little more familiarity with the codebase.
_These issues do not have the category prefix as two of them are special labels
recognized by GitHub. The special ones don't have emojis either._

- <span class="gh-label friendliness">good first issue</span>
  - **Description:** New-contributor friendly
- <span class="gh-label friendliness">help wanted</span>
  - **Description:** Open to participation from the community
- <span class="gh-label friendliness">🔒 staff only</span>
  - **Description:** Restricted to Creative Commons (CC) team members


### Miscellaneous

- <span class="gh-label miscellaneous">
    🤯 ノಠ益ಠノ彡┻━┻
  </span>
  - **Description:** Aaargh!
- <span class="gh-label invalid">
    invalid
  </span>
  - **Description:** Inappropriate or invalid (ex. Hacktoberfest spam)


## Usage rules

In the above categories, some are marked with an `*` sign. Those are mandatory
categories and every issue is required to have at least one label from those
categories.

Only issues labelled with
<span class="gh-label status-darker">
  🚦 status: awaiting triage
</span>
are allowed to not have all mandatory labels (seeing as they have not been
triaged yet).

Categories not marked with an `*` are optional and it is upto the discretion of
the maintainers to have apply labels from those categories to issues.
