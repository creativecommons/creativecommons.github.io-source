In December we held our second [CC Technology Summit at MIT](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-12-12) in Cambridge, MA. I think the day provided a great perspective on what we're doing at CC and how others are building a real community around it. If you weren't able to attend, we now have [audio](http://www.archive.org/details/cc-techsummit-200812-audio) and [video](http://labs.creativecommons.org/videos/tech-summit-dec-2008) available. And if you missed [the first one](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-06-18), the [video](http://labs.creativecommons.org/videos/cc-technology-summit-june-2008/) for that is available as well.

We're currently thinking about plans for the next event; if you have feedback or suggestions, email them to [techsummit@creativecommons.org](mailto:techsummit@creativecommons.org).
