Continuing the trend started when we [moved our source repository](http://labs.creativecommons.org/2008/04/01/version-control-changes/), today we're rolling out [issue tracking on code.creativecommons.org](http://code.creativecommons.org/issues). Our goals are two fold:

  1. Increase transparency regarding what we are doing and plan to do. If you find a bug or suggest an idea, we'd like to make sure it's tracked in a publicly accessible location where everyone can follow along.
  2. Tangentially, we'd like to make it easier for people to contribute to the work we're doing. We [semi-]frequently hear people say they'd like to help, but don't know where to start. We've had [Developer Challenges](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Developer_Challenges) forever but they're not easy to find and poorly maintained. I'm personally hoping that keeping the ideas in the same system we [developers] use every day will keep them in the forefront of our minds.



With respect to the first, we're initially tracking bugs here for three projects: the [license engine](http://creativecommons.org/license), Herder (a translation tool we'll be rolling out real soon now), and CC Learn's [Universal Education Search](http://learn.creativecommons.org/projects/oesearch) project. Feel free to create bugs, wishes, features for any CC project; we'll create the Project identifiers as we go.

With respect to challenges, I've created a **`community`** keyword we'll assign to projects that it's unlikely we'll tackle, but which might be appropriate for someone in the community who wants to contribute. [Luis'](http://tieguy.org/blog/) [idea](http://tieguy.org/blog/2008/09/03/creative-commons-picture-script-request/) from earlier this week is the [first](http://code.creativecommons.org/issues/issue7). I hope we have a giant pile of ideas (and a corresponding giant pile of completed ideas) by next year's Summer of Code.
